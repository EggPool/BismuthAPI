## Create a new address

Command "[Keygen](https://github.com/EggPool/BismuthAPI/blob/master/Doc/commands_reference.md#keygen)" returns [privkey, pubkey, address]

> Note: creating a new address is entropy and time intensive. If you plan to create a large #Â of addresses, it may be good to have several nodes running, so you can use one for address generation, and not slow down the regular tx polling.  You can also use local python scripts.


## Get a block by its height with its tx


## Get last block Height


## Construct and sign a tx
These options may depend on your custom infrastructure, key management and security procedures.

### Option1 (more secure)
Send All details to the node, including privkey

### Option2 (maybe less secure)
Construct and sign locally, then ask the node to insert the transaction in mempool.


## Broadcast a tx


## Get tx details from it's txid


## Get balances from addresses


# More

## Get Status info


## Polling for new transactions
